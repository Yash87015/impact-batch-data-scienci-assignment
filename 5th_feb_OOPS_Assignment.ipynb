        "CLASS:\n",
        " In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects(a particular data structure),providing intial values for state(memeber variables or attributes), and implementations of behaviour(member functios or methods).\n",
        "\n",
        " The user-defined objects are created using the \"class\" keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of future object. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. Classes are used to create and manage new objects and support inheritance- a key ingredient in object-oriented programming and a mechanism ofreusing code.\n",
        "\n",
        " A class is a way of organizing information about a type of data so a programmer can reuse elements when making multiple instances of that data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For example, if a programmer wanted to make three instances of Car, maybe a BMW, a Ferrari, and a Ford instance. The car class would allow the programmer to store similar information that is unique to each car(they are different models, and maybe different colors, etc.) and associate the appropriate information with each car.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In object-oriented programming, a class is a template definition of the methods and variables in a particular kind of object. Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables.\n",
        "\n",
        " The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming. The important ideas about classes are:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  1. A class can have subclasses that can inherit all or some of the characteristics of the class. In relation to each subclass, the class becomes the superclass.\n",
        "  2. Subclasses can also define their own methods and variables that are not part of their superclasses.\n",
        "  3. The structure of a class and its subclasses is called the class hierarchy\n",
        "\n",
        "OBJECT:\n",
        "\n",
        "In object-oriented programming(OOP),objects are the things you think about first in designing a program ad they are eventually derived from the process. In bedtweem each object, and even more gemeric classes are defined so that objects can share models and reuse the class definitions in their code. Each object is an instance of a particular class or subclass with the class's own methods or procedures and data variables. An object is what actually runs in the computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "CHARACTERISTICS OF AN OBJECT:\n",
        "\n",
        "All individual objects possess three basic characteristics--identity,state and behavior.Understanding these characteristics is crucial to knowing how objets and object-oriented logic work.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   1.Identity: It means that each object has its own object identifier and can be differentiated from all other objects. Each objects name, or identity, is unique and distinct from other objects.\n",
        "   2.State: It refers to the properties of an object. For example, values of variables in the object contain data that can be added, changed or deleted.\n",
        "   3.Behavior: It refers to actions that the object can take. For example, one object can respond to another object to carry out software functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example for objects are the real world objects: your dog, your desk, your bag, your bike and many more around us.\n",
        "\n",
        " **summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "  In OOP, classes provide a way to bundle data and functionality together, while objects are the concrete instances of these classes that hold specific data. This organization helps in creating modular, reusable, and maintainable code."

        "3) Abstraction\n",

        "4) Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "â†’ we see in deatails\n",
        "1. Inheritance:Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. This is useful because it allows you to create subclasses that are specialized versions of a parent class. For example, you could have a parent class.For example, you could have a parent class called Vehicle, with subclasses Car and Truck. The Vehicle class would contian general attributes and methods that are common to all vehicles, such as the number of wheels and the color.\n",
        "         \n",
        "2. Encapsulation:Encapsulation is the process of hiding information within an object so that it cannot be accessed directly from ouside the object. This allows you to control how data is used and prevents accidental modification of data. For example,you could have a class called Person with attributes such name and age. You could then create methods to get and set these attributes. This would allow ou to control how the data is used, and you could add validation to ensure that the data is valid before it is set.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Abstraction:Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object so that it can be used without understanding how it works, This allows you to create code that is easy to use and maintian.For example, you could have a class called Vehicle with methods such as drive and stop, the details of how these methods work are hidden from the user, so they are can simply call the methods and trust that they will woork as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism:polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. This is useful because it allows you to create code the that is more flexible and adaptable. FOr example, you could have a class called Shape with subclasses Circle and Rectangle. The Shape class would contain general methods such as getArea and getPerimeter. The Circle and Rectagle subclasses would then each have their own unique implementation of these methods."

        "Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. This is useful because it allows you to create subclasses that are specialized versions of a parent class. For example, you could have a parent class.For example, you could have a parent class called Vehicle, with subclasses Car and Truck. The Vehicle class would contian general attributes and methods that are common to all vehicles, such as the number of wheels and the color.\n",
